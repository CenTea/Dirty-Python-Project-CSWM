# Dirty-Python-Project-CSWM
A project I had for cloud computing.

There are better ways to go around this, but unfortunately there was a time factor to deal with.

Notable Issues:
  Uses UDP inefficiently
  The way Sockets were used
  The way Subprocesses were managed and used.

Intended to be a process checking system for Linux between different computers/VMs.
It was tried on AWS and attempted to manage multiple EC2 Ubuntu systems.

Tested and made on xUbuntu 14.04:
  May not work with new versions of xUbuntu.
